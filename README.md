# AM2R-WaveFunctionCollapseMapGenerator
 
This is a small demo for the application of the Wave Function Collapse Algorithm to generate AM2R Maps.
To run the code, simply start WaveFunctionCollapse.py. The program will ask you how many tiles you want per side. This is talking about the sidelength of the map square in tiles with a maximum of 57 tiles per side (3.249 tiles total).
The program creates an output that can be parsed by the AM2R Mapping Tool (https://github.com/DodoBirby/Am2r-mapping-tool/releases/tag/0.3.1).
