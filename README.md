# AM2R-WaveFunctionCollapseMapGenerator
 
This is a small demo for the application of a Branching algorithm to generate AM2R Maps.
To run the code, simply start BranchingFloorGenerator.py. The program will ask you how many tiles you want per side. This is talking about the sidelength of the map rectangle in tiles with a maximum of 74 tiles wide and 57 tiles high (4.218 tiles total).
The program creates an output (BranchingOutput.json) that can be parsed by the AM2R Mapping Tool (https://github.com/DodoBirby/Am2r-mapping-tool/releases/tag/0.3.1).
